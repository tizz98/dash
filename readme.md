# The Open Dashboard Project
A [ZUMH](http://zumh.org) project.

## About
The Open Dashboard Project is an open source personal dashboard project aimed at creating the perfect personal dashboard.

As of 10-16-14 it's still just a single static webpage and the stocks don't work but hopefully by Thanksgiving time it will have a Ruby on Rails backend to support it. It's still very buggy and this should not be used for anything important as it's still highly in development. index-dev.html is for experimental things I am trying at the moment, index.html is the "master" and most used index file.

When complete a working demo will be [here](http://dash.zumh.org). Until then stay updated with ZUMH on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ZUMH_tweets). See the license for the legal stuff.
